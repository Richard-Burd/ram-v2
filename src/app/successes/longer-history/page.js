                  Led the effort that resulted in Tennessee being the first U.S.
                  state with soil-based compost quality standards as an
                  incentive class (Type A), 1993-final vote June 2, 1998. This
                  began with arguments against staff favoring a
                  disposal-friendly interpretation of the State Solid Waste
                  Management Act of 1991. The State Solid Waste Disposal Control
                  Board rejected citizens on this routinely, until the Board
                  Chair admitted <i>RAM&apos;s</i> John van der Harst had one
                  unarguable point: How could the state allow composting to
                  qualify as diversion without defining what constituted
                  compost? So, the Board authorized staff to draft standards.
                  Two solicitations of public comments were made, before both
                  preliminary and final rules were drafted. A battle raged
                  between environmental groups' desire for "soil-based"
                  standards and some established industry's convenient
                  preference for lax 40 CFR Part 503 allowances. RAM educated
                  groups statewide about the differences. Staff person Mike
                  Apple commented to the Board about how unusually many persons
                  submitted comments.

                <p className="pt-4">
                  The battle raged for years. Finally the late Arthur Smith, the
                  lone Board member representing the environmental community,
                  asked John if he would accept a two-tier compromise that used
                  the terminology "Type A" instead of "Class A" to Label a
                  soil-based set of heavy metal level limits, as a
                  higher-quality class, in addition to allowing the more lax
                  standards as "Type B." John agreed. Otherwise the lower
                  standards would likely become the only rule. On the positive
                  side, this was a first foothold in the U.S. for standards that
                  previously only existed in some Northern European countries
                  like the Netherlands and Germany, plus Canada.

                  Achieved the world&apos;s first and only, to-date (to our
                  knowledge),voluntary closure of a large, financially viable
                  waste-to-energy incinerator with up-to-date air pollution

                  1993-Metro Council vote Jan 15, 2002 and closure May 23, 2002.
                  In late 1993, <i>RAM&apos;s</i> John van der Harst developed a
                  5-scenario comparison of options, including internalizing
                  normally externalized costs. These showed converting the
                  Thermal Plant to an electric and natural gas powered district
                  energy system would be advantageous, even if material recovery
                  from tonnage of waste fed to it consisted of only what could
                  be easily recovered from processing mixed waste.

                <p className="pt-4">
                  At that point John became the only person who thought it was
                  possible to close the incinerator. John then embarked on a
                  campaign to do that, starting with assembling allies. It took
                  attending five BURNT meetings, for example, to finally
                  convince that group to join the campaign. Kathleen Hersk
                  (later Kathleen Rosemary), simplified John's work to a
                  2-scenario presentation, which she presented to small sets of
                  Metro Councilmembers. After leading a couple of sessions, she
                  bowed out. John gathered others, like Sherry Force, to assist
                  in continuing those sessions. Many of those, over several
                  years, gradually built support for closure among
                  officeholders. Press conferences were more colorful, with
                  costumes John built like the infamous Walking Incinerator, and
                  the Walking Ashfill, becoming media personalities.

                  Eliminated permitting of treated incinerator ash as loose
                  construction material in several states, 1993-present.
                  Inexperienced state staff had accepted a Health Risk
                  Assessment (HRA) submitted by American Ash Recycling Corp. of
                  Tennessee (AAR-TN), which claimed that incinerator ash,
                  sprayed with a phosphoric acid solution, was rendered safe for
                  use in certain below-grade fill applications. The state then
                  permitted those uses. <i>RAM&apos;s</i> John van der Harst was
                  the first person to complain to the state that applications he
                  observed fell far outside permitted uses. The state replied
                  that they found no violation. This blind-eye response was
                  later weaponized repeatedly by AAR-TN, AAR-NE, AAR, and
                  Environmental Capital Holdings as they sued John and{" "}
                  <i>RAM</i> for what they called "tortious interference with
                  legitimate business interests." This classic SLAPP suit
                  (Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation) was an
                  attempt to silence John, after his experiences with AAR-TN
                  surfaced in state after state in which AAR sought to expand
                  their business.

                <p className="pt-4">
                  Activists in those states, desperate for help, turned to John
                  repeatedly, as they had no other experienced source
                  sympathetic to their causes. To spare <i>RAM</i>, which was
                  then dropped from the lawsuit, John took full responsibility
                  for his actions. <i>RAM</i> thereafter was an affiliation
                  label in this case. John and his attorneys Mary Parker,
                  assisted by Stacy Gibson, received lots of newspaper coverage
                  and help from activists who knew John. Sandy Hepler organized
                  a well-attended fundraiser at Leith Patton's house, featuring
                  Elizabeth Cutler's music. Sherry Sloan and Carl Evertson
                  poured time into visiting treated ash sites, and together with
                  John, flooded the state with overwhelming evidence of permit
                  violations on many sites. Sherry Force and Steve Henry helped
                  as well. John attacked arbitrary and subjective assumptions
                  made in the HRA.

                  The state finally hired someone with some experience in HRAs.
                  The state started issuing Notices of Violation, including
                  suspending AAR-TN's operating permit for a period. Then, it
                  further limited uses. The initial lawsuit morphed into a
                  series of lawsuits over more than three years, with John
                  surviving every attack. Finally a new mayoral administration,
                  and new Metro Council, facing further financial requests by
                  AAR-TN and the ash-supplying incinerator, pulled the plug on
                  both of them. Then, John turned his attention to a facility
                  that AAR had managed to get permitted in York, Pennsylvania,
                  while he was consumed with the lawsuits. One month after
                  engaging there, educating local activists about violations
                  complaints, the first newspaper article came. Then, after a
                  former employee turned against AAR-PA, the state pulled its
                  permit. Facing legal pushback, the state finally allowed
                  AAR-PA to produce treated ash aggregate again, but only for
                  use as daily landfill cover.

                Michael Goff for his assessment of a long, national report, and
                a more crisply composed graphic. John van der Harst got that
                condensed on to one page.

                Submitted legislation content to achieve independent disposal
                tax valuation and applications of this, 2012. Though Metro
                Davidson County's Dept. of Public Works blocked this, citing
                restrictive state law, the logic of this was made more obvious
                by this effort, and the ensuing illogical blockage.

                  Successfully lobbied to change Tennessee state law to allow
                  Davidson County to include all costs associated with solid
                  waste disposal in assessed fees, 2015-signed into law 2016.
                  Kudos to Sen. Jeff Yarbro (D) and the late Rep. Bill Beck (D)
                  for sponsoring the legislation with then-Rep. Brenda Gilmore
                  (D) joining Bill as a sponsor. Bill language credits are
                  deserved by Rep. Harold Love (D), composed in a 2015 meeting
                  with <i>RAM&apos;s</i> Michael Goff (who set up the meeting),
                  Jeff Broussal, Karen Cisler, and John van der Harst. Michael
                  also set up a 2015 meeting with Sen. Frank Southerland (R),
                  who chaired the key Senate Committee.

                  John worked with legislative aides to draft final bill
                  language. <i>RAM&apos;s</i> Ursula King put in heavy lobbying
                  time accompanying John. An Impassioned floor address by Sen
                  Bill Ketron (R) of Rutherford County was appreciated, as he
                  hoped this would actually be used to reduce landfilling. He
                  correctly doubted government bureaucrats' resolve. Support was
                  not unanimous in either chamber, but not too far off. The
                  Sierra Club's lobbyist, Scott Banbury, helped. Lobbyist
                  Stewart Cliften advised as well.

                Successfully persuaded the Davidson County Solid Waste Region
                Board to call for a Zero-Waste Plan for its 10-year update, for
                the first time, March 2017. Credit to Linda Breggin for leading,
                with John van der Harst's help, on this.

                Efforts (19 and 20 above) resulted in the Scope of Work for the
                plan (22 above) including "Triple Bottom Line" economic
                assessment of recycling benefits. <i>RAM&apos;s</i> education on
                this was too much for Metro's Dept. of Public Works to feel
                willing to omit this. MPW watered down plenty otherwise, despite{" "}
                <i>RAM&apos;s</i> objections. MPW and its consultants continued
                to appear to favor disposal industry interests. The Board
                continued to allow itself to be manipulated by these, not
                allowing public comment between stating initial intent and
                presentation of final product. <i>RAM&apos;s</i> John van der
                Harst went on record as stating methodology in this plan, as
                drafted, would unfortunately not even come close to meeting the
                Board-stated objective. Performance since has so far confirmed
                that assessment.
