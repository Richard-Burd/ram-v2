                One valid criticism of environmental groups by industry is that
                they just have no feel for the subject, compared with those who
                deal with it for a living. Having hands-on experience is
                critical to countering that otherwise justified criticism.

                Future <i>RAM</i>sters Sandy Loyd, Connie Collopy, and John van
                der Harst collected bags of compacted and uncompacted waste to
                analyze for recoverability potential. The examination took place
                at a meeting of another group dedicated to the subject. Those
                who thought such groups should only talk about it were not happy
                to see this activity at a nearby table. Connie loved it. Quite a
                contrast. It foretold a future split between the talkers and the
                doers.

                Surprises await. E.g. When one bag was opened and dumped, what
                came out first was a car-engine's quantity of oil, followed by
                the styrofoam cooler that had contained it. Wow. Yeah. Pyrolysis
                definitely has a role in market options. And household hazardous
                waste drop-off options. Maybe HHW collection options as well.

                Not all glass breaks during compaction, but when it does, it
                explodes into lots of little shards that can embed into other
                materials, like paper. If collection and processing were
                grouped, in a franchise award, there would be an internal
                incentive to compact a bit less, to enhance market value of
                recovered materials.

                Wet/dry systems are the most cost-effective approach for many
                waste streams. As such, the disposal industry is more eager to
                attack these than most other alternatives. That makes it more
                important to gain hands-on experience for these, in order to:
