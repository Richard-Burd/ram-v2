                First, most environmental damage from disposal happens during
                virgin resource extraction. Far more. On average, roughly 50
                times more. Not even remotely close. Varies widely by type of
                material. E.g. 1 ton of cell phones contains more gold than 1
                ton of ore mined to extract that same amount of gold. About half
                of all U.S. solid waste is mining processing waste, but much
                mining required for U.S. goods happens outside the U.S.

                Second, most economic benefit from recycling comes from
                manufacturing products from recovered materials as feedstock.
                Developing local remanufacturing makes internalizing material
                recovery benefits easier for policymakers to understand, and

                Third, typically most, about 2/3, of municipal solid waste (MSW)
                comes from commercial sources. Much of that is construction &
                demolition (C&D) wastes. Both of these are typically far richer
                in recyclable material value, and easier to recover from, than
                residential MSW. Often they are already either wet or dry
                streams, which makes cost-efficient wet/dry material recovery
                techniques easier to apply. In many cases, much larger
                quantities of single commodities are easy to separate at the
                source. Many source-separation practices are done under
                employers' supervision.

                    Disposal interests keep the focus on this sector by focusing
                    on gimmicks like "Pay-As-You-Throw" (PAYT), with its endless
                    complications, and preservation of disposal. PAYT tricks
                    citizens and officeholders into thinking the problem can be
                    fixed most through higher participation rates, instead of
                    switching to much higher-yield wet/dry systems. In wet/dry
                    systems, participation boosts quality. Not diversion.
                    Wet/dry systems typically recover both more high-quality
                    materials, and more low-quality materials, than
                    source-separated recycling programs. Recovery via wet/dry
                    systems is only limited by market availability. Markets most
                    typically scarce involve composting, aggregates,
                    heavy-molded/extruded products, and pyrolysis.

                        from the jurisdiction aiming for zero waste -- to make
                        these far higher than processing facility tipping fees.
                        If such charges are levied by an extra-jurisdictional
                        disposal entity, it would help the flow control to work
                        if part of the cost assessed were to go to the disposal
                        entity, to pay for their efforts, and in order to assure
                        their cooperation.

                        Collection needs to be coordinated with processing (A-F
                        above). Franchising should be considered, where a single
                        collection and processing entity is obligated to produce
                        the desired results, with penalties for failure
                        sufficient to assure compliance. As a starting point for
                        developing this, the city of San Jose, California has
                        made their contract for this in the commercial sector
                        (for a wet/dry approach) available to the public online.
