            When <i>RAM</i> began, Davidson and Sumner Counties incinerated much
            of their solid waste. RAM’s efforts to end this included education
            sessions which explained the Davidson County system clearly.
            Following a pilot in Sumner County, in late 1993, Davidson County
            began paying American Ash Recycling Corp. of TN (AAR) to distribute
            treated incinerator ash as loose construction fill material. RAM
            objected. <i>RAM's</i> documentation was sought by environmental
            groups in many states. Tired of this, AAR sued <i>RAM</i> in early
            1997. This forced RAM to investigate further. This led to
            discoveries which ultimately led Davidson County to end both
            incineration and its use of AAR. <i>RAM</i> showed that loose,
            treated incinerator ash, used as construction fill, would make
            harmful contents more available to soil life than AAR’s submitted
            health risk assessment modeling had assumed.
